# arduino-ohmmeter
 
Very simple implementation of an ohmmeter. In progress...

TODO:
1) Output to a screen of whatever type.
2) Reduce memory usage (optimize variables). (string functions add a lot of memory usage, but it's ok for now since we're getting rid of that later on anyway)
3) Proper documentation/readme in both Russian and English.
4) Build the actual physical thing using transistors instead of diodes, because diodes have a tendency to increase their resistance relative to current.
5) Make schematics public whenever they are done.
